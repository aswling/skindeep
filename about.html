<div class="about">
	<p>Identity is formed by a multitude of experiences and characteristics that cannot be fully understood from just looking at the surface. <b>Skin Deep</b> is an interactive website using audio and minimalist visuals that seeks to show the different aspects of identity and the personal conflicts which often arise among these parts. We asked students about how they view their own identity, and paired the audio of each interview with a color swatch based on interviewees’ skin tones. We were inspired by Synecdoche by Korean-American artist Byron Kim, in which Kim paints canvases based on skin colors. By pairing the interviewee’s skin tone to their recording the artificial “skin” is given life by the interviewee’s story, exploring the issue of making simplifying assumptions based on appearance and the tension within individual identity.</p>
